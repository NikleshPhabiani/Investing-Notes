* How to calculate risk?
	- Standard Deviation.    
		 - Revolving more around mutual funds
		 - Compares to its own average
		 
		 	Eg: 12% avg. return. Range: 8% to 16%. Std. Deviation: 4%
	- Beta
		- Revolving more around stocks
		- Used a lot with individual stocks, wherein an individual stock is compared to an index.
		- Beta of 1 matches index
		- Beta > 1: More volatile than market (Low more, Up more)
		- Beta < 1: Less volatile than market (Low less, Up less)
		
## Types of Funds
* **Index Funds**
	- Trying to match the market that the index follows; eg: Vanguard S&P 500 Index Fund, Russell 2000 (Small Cap)
	- Trying to be the average of the market that it is following
	- **Advantages**
		- Low cost (Passively trying to match the index, Less management and research so fees are less compared to a mutual fund)
		- Potential for more diversification
	- **Disadvantages**
		- No fund manager with vested interest
		- Entire index might be down
		- Less diversified (Tied to a particular index, which is let's say maybe specific US stocks)
		- Can be heavily weighted in a few positions (Big companies will influence it more i.e Holdings of a company)
* **Exchange Traded Funds (ETF)**
	- Holds baskets of different assets (Stocks, Bonds etc.)
	- Low expense ratio (Not frequent buying and selling)
	- **Difference from Mutual Fund**
		- Trade like a stock on the market
		- Price keeps changing during the day as opposed to once a day for a mutual fund
		- Can buy 1 share (No minimum like mutual fund)
